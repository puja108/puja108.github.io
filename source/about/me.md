Hi, I'm Puja. I'm Vice President of Product Relations at Giant Swarm, where we build a managed Cloud Native Developer Platform based on Kubernetes. I'm also a CNCF Ambassador and regularly speak at technology and startup events around the globe.
In the past I have worked in various startups and software projects; first as a developer later in product management roles. Next to that I used to be an external expert advisor to the European Commission and a Network Science researcher working on projects in the fields of IT security, technology startups, and venture capital. In my spare time I coach technology startups at international accelerator programs and dabble in various topics around technology innovation.
